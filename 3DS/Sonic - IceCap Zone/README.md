# Sonic - IceCap Zone

Version: 1.2.1

## Description
A cold theme, based on IceCap Zone from *Sonic the Hedgehog 3*. Watch the blue hedgehog snowboarding with this fan art by Gaseiki, while listening to a certain nostalgic music. Will you find the easter egg?

## Volume
In order to make the volume variations a little more fun, I decided to replace the speaker with an icon of Tails' head. If:
- his eyes are closed, the volume is cut
- his eyes are half-open, the volume is very low
- his eyes are open, the volume is low/normal
- his eyes and mouth are open, the volume is normal/strong
- he laughs, the volume is very loud/at its highest

## Easter egg
As the description says, I have hidden an easter egg in this theme. It's easy to find, you may have already seen it without realizing it. If you are a Sonic fan and know "a little" about the history of the development of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, you should be able to identify it with the theme music (yeah, that's a clue).
